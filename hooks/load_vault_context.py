"""SessionStart hook: tell the session where the skill lives, and (inside the vault)
load the vault's _CLAUDE.md operating manual.

Two pieces of context are injected:

1. **Skill root** - always. Slash commands run bundled scripts (`uv run --directory
   <root> -m scripts...`) and read bundled `references/`, but CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is
   only set for plugin hook/MCP subprocesses, NOT for the Bash a command later runs.
   So the model must carry the absolute install path itself; this hook publishes it.
   The path comes from CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT when set, else from this file's own location
   (the hook always lives at <skill root>/hooks/, in every install mode).

2. **Vault manual** - only when the session's cwd is inside $OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH and
   that vault has a _CLAUDE.md. Gated so a non-vault session doesn't get a manual it
   has no use for, and capped: Claude Code replaces any hook output over 10,000
   characters with a 2 KB preview plus a file path, so a manual larger than that
   arrives cut off inside its first section. Since the header says the manual is
   already loaded and SKILL.md tells the session not to re-read it, a truncated
   manual reads as a complete one and every rule past the cut silently stops
   applying (#270). Over the budget the hook injects a pointer that says the manual
   is NOT loaded and must be read, instead of a fragment that claims it is.

   The better fix is upstream of this hook: a vault whose `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   holds `@../_CLAUDE.md` gets the whole manual loaded natively by Claude Code, at
   any size and with no interpreter involved. `/obsidian-init` and
   `bootstrap_vault.py` write that import; this cap is the floor under vaults that
   do not have it.

Path normalization handles Windows ("C:\\..."), MSYS ("/c/..."), and POSIX ("/...")
so the vault match works regardless of which form the harness or env var uses.
