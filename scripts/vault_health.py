vault_health.py - Obsidian Second Brain Health Check

Audits an Obsidian vault for structural issues:
- Duplicate notes (same concept, multiple files)
- Orphaned notes (no incoming links)
- Stale tasks (overdue, no recent activity)
- Notes missing frontmatter
- Notes with frontmatter trapped in a leading ```markdown code fence (unwrap, do not add)
- Byte-level corruption: NUL bytes, or a duplicate frontmatter block buried behind a
  mid-file BOM (merge the blocks, do not add another; rg/grep are BLIND to NUL files)
- Empty folders
- Wanted notes (links to notes not written yet - a wishlist, not errors)
- Templates left in notes (unfilled Templater syntax)

Usage:
    python vault_health.py --path ~/my-vault
    python vault_health.py --path ~/my-vault --json     # JSON output (for Claude)

Optional per-vault config at `<vault>/.vault-config.json` extends the built-in
exclude list (additive, never overrides the hardcoded EXCLUDE_DIRS):
    {
      "exclude-dirs":  ["_card-pool", "_candidates"],  # dir names anywhere in the tree
      "exclude-paths": ["Archive/Backup"],             # vault-relative path prefixes
      "rewrite_policy": "unattended"                   # opt out of the /obsidian-ingest
                                                       # confirm-before-rewrite gate (#250)
    }
A missing or malformed file is ignored silently. See VaultExcludes, and
load_rewrite_policy for the one key that is not about exclusions.
